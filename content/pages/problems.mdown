# Current projects

Here are the problems we will be being worked on at the next RHoK weekend in June.

### Resilience

After a bush fire, flood, or cyclone, emergency response management personnel need to know what issues need to be resolved, get accurate and timely descriptions of their severity and location, to be able to prioritise them, to determine which types of resources are needed for their resolution, and to track their resolution. Currently, issues are handled by verbal description, relayed in the first instance over the phone from a member of the public, to a centralised response call centre, and then to the local emergency response crews. At each step, and with each relay of information, the precise location and an accurate description may be diluted or lost. Indeed, an accurate location and description may not have been captured in the first place. For example, a tree is across the road, a road section is washed away, a fence is breached and stock is wandering.
